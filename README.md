# AMG's iRacingPlanner
As an *iRacing* user I always found quite difficult to plan my season. When a new season schedule is released, 
I used to go the schedule pdf and build a table with the series, tracks and cars. Once build, I tried to identify
which were the best options to race and what tracks and cars to buy for the season.

This was quite a pain, so I decided to code this little tool that builds a table with all the series, cars and
tracks for the current season.

## How to install
Just download latest release (https://github.com/amgart/iracingPlanner/releases), unzip it and put it in your favourite folder.
Now you only need to double-click *iracing-planner.exe*
For more information, you can see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_c2TQMzfDY&ab_channel=Amgart)

## How to use
When the tool starts the *Dashboard* screen is shown, just go to *My cars* tab and select the cars you own on *iRacing*. 
Select too your owned tracks on *My tracks* tab.

Once you have done this, you can return to the main *Dashboard* tab, and you will see the table of series 
as you configured it.

In the *Dashboard* tab will you find the following columns:
*   Series name (if the cell paints green means that you have at least 8 tracks, and you can obtain race participation credits with the series)
*   License needed for racing the series (R, D, C, B or A)
*   Category of the series (Road, Oval, Dirt Oval or RX)
*   Cars allowed for the series (if the cell paints green means that you own at least one car)
*   Setup type (fixed or open)
*   Number of tracks you can race for this series
*   Weeks: the list of tracks per week (if the cell paints green means that you own the track). 
Note that past weeks will be shown in grey color. Current week will be the first column in white.

Moreover, you can use the upper fields to filter the results in the *Dashboard* table. You can filter by:
*   Series name
*   Participation credits possibility
*   Category
*   License needed
*   Setup type
*   Owned cars only
*   Favorite content

## How the data is obtained
The schedule for the current season, cars and tracks are stored as a json files inside the tool. 
These json files are obtained through *iRacing* API calls and contains all the series, with the corresponding 
tracks per week, license, categories, cars, and other information. These json files need to be updated each season.
For updating these files, please follow these steps:
*   Go to the folder were you have the application installed (i.e. C:/Programs/AMG's iRacing Planner)
*   Once inside the main folder, navigate to resources/assets/
*   Open the file updater-ps.ps1 with Notepad (or similar)
*   In the second line, specify your iRacing email (in lower case, if not, it won't work)
*   In the third line, specify your iRacing password
*   Close the file
*   Execute the file updater.bat

If the process succeed, you can now open AMG's iRacing Planner and you should see the new season series, cars and tracks.
Please, note that your email and password is only used for this updater tool. AMG's iRacing Planner does not use
your credentials for anything.

This tool uses PowerShell to get the information from iRacing. PowerShell is built in Windows 10 and upper but 
in case you do not have installed PowerShell, please download and install it or the script won't work.

Finally, I would like to mention that even it is not needed to update AMG's iRacing Planner to get the new seasons info
anymore, I encourage you to keep downloading the newer versions of the app, as I will be adding new features :)
You can find download latest release in [here](https://github.com/amgart/iracingPlanner/releases).

## Known issues and limitations
*   If the serie has less than 12 races, the series is not shown, as this causes confusion about when the races happen.

## Future features planned
*   Visual enhancements
*   Possibility to filter by multiple values in same filter. For example: show series with licenses A, B and C. At the moment this is not possible.
*   Possibility to introduce your iRacing account info.
*   *Dashboard* is automatically calculated each season instead of manually updating the tool.
*   Owned cars and tracks are automatically updated with your *iRacing* account.
*   Price calculator for the user to use when planning the new season and being able to know how much money he needs to spend.
