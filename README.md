# AMG's iRacingPlanner
As an *iRacing* user I always found quite difficult to plan my season. When a new season schedule is released,
I used to go the schedule pdf and build a table with the series, tracks and cars. Once build, I tried to identify
which were the best options to race and what tracks and cars to buy for the season.

This was quite a pain, so I decided to code this little tool that builds a table with all the series, cars and
tracks for the current season.

## How to use
Go to the following url: https://amgiracingplanner.web.app/login
If you are not registered, introduce your desired user and password and click on 'Sign up'. After receiving the
confirmation message you can now login.
After login, the *Dashboard* screen is shown, just go to *My cars* tab and select the cars you own on *iRacing*.
Select too your owned tracks on *My tracks* tab.

Once you have done this, you can return to the main *Dashboard* tab, and you will see the table of series
as you configured it.
You will see in green the content that you have and what you can race.

In the *Dashboard* tab will you find the following columns:
*   Series name (if the cell paints green means that you have at least 8 tracks, and you can obtain race participation credits with the series)
*   License needed for racing the series (R, D, C, B or A)
*   Category of the series (Sports Car, Formula, Oval, Dirt Oval or RX)
*   Cars allowed for the series (if the cell paints green means that you own at least one car)
*   Setup type (fixed or open)
*   Number of tracks you can race for this series. If you are a PRO user you will see the duration of the race and if there is change of rain.
*   Weeks: the list of tracks per week (if the cell paints green means that you own the track).
    Note that past weeks will be shown in grey color. Current week will be the first column in white.


Moreover, you can use the upper fields to filter the results in the *Dashboard* table. You can filter by:
*   Series name
*   Participation credits possibility
*   Category
*   License needed
*   Setup type
*   Owned cars only
*   Favorite content

## Known issues and limitations
*   If the serie has more than 12 races, the series is not shown at this moment, I am trying to find a way of showing the info without being confusing.

## Future features planned
*   Showing more info about cars and tracks
*   Recommendations about what to race
*   Possibility to filter by multiple values in same filter. For example: show series with licenses A, B and C. At the moment this is not possible.
*   Possibility to introduce your iRacing account info.
*   Owned cars and tracks are automatically updated with your *iRacing* account.
*   Price calculator for the user to use when planning the new season and being able to know how much money he needs to spend.
