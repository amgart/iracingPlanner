# AMG's iRacingPlanner
As an *iRacing* user I always found quite difficult to plan my season. When a new season schedule is released,
I used to go the schedule pdf and build a table with the series, tracks and cars. Once build, I tried to identify
which were the best options to race and what tracks and cars to buy for the season.

This was quite a pain, so I decided to code this little tool that builds a table with all the series, cars and
tracks for the current season.

## How to use
Access to the following url: https://amgiracingplanner.web.app/login

If you are not registered, introduce your desired user and password and click on 'Sign up'. After receiving the
confirmation message you can now login.
After login, the *Dashboard* screen is shown, just go to *My cars* tab and select the cars you own on *iRacing*.
Select too your owned tracks on *My tracks* tab.

Once you have done this, you can return to the main *Dashboard* tab, and you will see the table of series
as you configured it.
You will see in green the content that you have and what you can race.

In the *Dashboard* tab will you find the following columns:
*   Series name (if the cell paints green means that you have at least 8 tracks, and you can obtain race participation credits with the series)
*   License needed for racing the series (R, D, C, B or A)
*   Type of the series (Sports Car, Formula, Oval, Dirt Oval or RX)
*   Cars allowed for the series (owned cars will be painted in green)
*   Setup type (fixed or open)
*   If the serie is team Racing or not
*   Number of tracks you can race for this series. If you are a PRO user you will see the duration of the race and if there is change of rain.
*   Weeks: the list of tracks per week (if the cell paints green means that you own the track).
    Note that past weeks will be shown in grey color. Current week will be the first column in white.


Moreover, you can use the upper fields to filter the results in the *Dashboard* table. You can filter by:
*   Series name
*   Participation credits possibility
*   Category
*   License needed
*   Setup type
*   Owned cars only
*   Favorite content
*   If rain is enabled for a serie
*   If the serie is team racing or not

## Known issues and limitations
*   If a series has more than 12 races, then it is not shown at this moment, I am trying to find a way of showing the info without being confusing.
*   If a series does not follow the iRacing week pattern (from tuesday to next monday), when adding an event to the calendar, days selected are not the proper ones.

## PRO members
There are some features that only available for PRO members. The list of current available features are:
*   See the duration of the races in the *Dashboard* tab
*   See the % of rain chance of a race in the *Dashboard* tab
*   Filtering in the *Series*, *Cars* and *Tracks* tabs
*   Access to the *Calendar* tab to plan your season
*   View the number of times a track is used in the current season directly in the *Track* tab (free users can see it too, but in the track detail)
    If you want to be a PRO member, please email me to amgart88@gmail.com and I will let you know the steps to become a PRO member.

## Using the Calendar tab
If you want to create your own calendar to plan your season more in deep. You can create your events from the *Dashboard* tab.
To do it, just click on the calendar icon in a race where you have the track and the car, select the day you want to race and click on *Add*.
Once done this, if you go to the *Calendar* tab you will see the events in the day you selected.

Moreover, if you want to create your own custom event, just click on the '+' button, type a description, select a date and click on 'Add'. The event will be added in the Calendar.

## Using the Settings tab
In the *Settings* tab you can customize your experience in the app. The following settings at this moment are:
*   Configure if you want to see the % chance of rain for all weeks in the *Dashboard* tab.
*   Configure if you want to see the % chance of rain only for past weeks in the *Dashboard* tab.

## Future features planned
*   Showing more info about cars, tracks and series
*   Recommendations about what to race
*   Possibility to filter by multiple values in same filter. For example: show series with licenses A, B and C. At the moment this is not possible.
*   Possibility to introduce your iRacing account info.
*   Owned cars and tracks are automatically updated with your *iRacing* account.
*   Price calculator for the user to use when planning the new season and being able to know how much money he needs to spend.
*   Create your own custom events on the *Calendar* tab
*   Create a calendar for your drivers (if you are a team manager)
*   Expand the tool to more competitions (LowFuelMotorsport for example)
