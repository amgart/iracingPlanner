# iRacingPlanner
As an *iRacing* user I always found quite difficult to plan my season. When a new season schedule is released, 
I used to go the schedule pdf and build a table with the series, tracks and cars. Once build, I tried to identify
which were the best options to race and what tracks and cars to buy for the season.

This was quite a pain, so I decided to code this little tool that builds a table with all the series, cars and
tracks for the current season.

## How to install
Before running the app you need to make sure that you have Java installed. If you have not installed it, please
follow these steps (https://www.java.com/en/download/help/windows_manual_download.html).
If you already have at least Java 16 installed, then download latest release 
(https://github.com/amgart/iracingPlanner/releases), unzip it and put it in your favourite folder.
Open a commandPrompt, navigate to the folder and execute it with the following command:

*java -jar iRacingPlanner-1.0.jar* 

Note: I know that this can be a bit complicated, in future releases I will improve this.

## How to use
With the tool up and running, just go to *My cars* tab and select the cars you own on *iRacing*. 
Select too your owned tracks on *My tracks* tab.

Once you have done this, you can return to the main *Dashboard* tab and you will see the table of series 
as you configured it.

In the *Dashboard* tab will you find the following columns:
  *   Serie name
  *   License needed for racing the series (R, D, C, B or A)
  *   Category of the serie (Road, Oval, Dirt Oval or RX)
  *   Cars allowed for the serie (if the cell paints green means that you own at least one car)
  *   Number of tracks missing for the series (if the cell paints green means that you have at least 8 tracks and you can obtain *iDollars* with the serie)
  *   Weeks: the list of tracks per week (if the cell paints green means that you own the track)

## How the data is obtained
The schedule for the current season is stored as a json file inside the tool. This json file is obtained through
an *iRacing* API call and contains all the series, with the corresponding tracks per week, license, categories, 
cars, and other information. This json needs to be updated each season. Please read the 
*How to update the tool* section.

## Known issues and limitations
  *   At this moment the tool only displays series with 12 weeks.
  *   The json file needs to be updated every season. Please read *How to update the tool* section.
  *   The json file can contain duplicated cars and/or tracks. This causes the tool to display the cars and/or tracks duplicated as they have different names in the json. If this happens, please select all the cars/tracks that apply.
  *   The json does not contain which of the cars/tracks are included in the starter pack (not needed to buy). The tool cannot know which ones are owned by default, so please, select all cars and tracks.

## Future features planned
  *   Possibility to add favourite cars, tracks and series.
  *   Possibility to filter by category, license, cars and favourites in the *Dashboard* tab.
  *   *Dashboard* is automatically calculated each season instead of manually updating the tool.
  *   Price calculator for the user to use when planning the new season and being able to know how much money he needs to spend.
  *   Owned cars and tracks are automatically updated with your *iRacing* account instead of the current tabs configuration.
