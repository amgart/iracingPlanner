    <div class="mt-1">
      <span>Hey there!</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span>My name is Albert and I am an enthusiast of simRacing. Some years ago I registered into
        iRacing and with the iRacing's PDF schedule I think it is quite complicated to plan a
        season depending on your preferences, cars and tracks... so after some seasons I decided
        to create this simple tool to help simRacers planning their season.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-1">
      <b>Instructions:</b>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span>When the tool starts, just select your owned cars and tracks in the corresponding tabs and you will see your
        season in the dashboard tab.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-1">
      <b>Some notes:</b>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>This app uses json files produced with iRacing API calls for obtaining the current
          season, cars and tracks. These json files need to be updated manually each season. For updating them,
          please follow the steps mentioned in the section 'How the data is obtained' from
          <a href="https://github.com/amgart/iracingPlanner" target="_blank">
            here</a>.</li>
        <li>You can download latest releases in
          <a href="https://github.com/amgart/iracingPlanner/releases" target="_blank">
            here</a>.</li>
        <li>The list of cars and tracks are automatically generated with the mentioned json. It is
          possible that if a car or a track is not used and does not appear in the json, you won't
          find it in the list.</li>
        <li>Series with less than 12 races on the season are not shown, as this was confusing because
          the time of the races does not appear in the json file. If you want to
          race this series please take into account that this series does not appear.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-1">
      <b>Future steps:</b>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span>I know that this tool needs a lot of new features, fixes and improvements, but please,
      understand that I do not have a lot of time.
      You can provide me some feedback or comment new features in my Github repository or leave me a
      comment somewhere in the social media.
      New features planned includes:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Possiblity to filter by multiple values in same filter. For example: show series for licenses A, B and C.</li>
        <li>Possiblity to enter your iRacing account info. This can be used to:</li>
          <li>Auto calculate current season instead of updating the json files with the updater</li>
          <li>Owned content loaded from your iRacing account</li>
        <li>Visual enhancements</li>
        <li>Price calculator (if you want to plan what to buy)</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-1">
      <b>Useful info and links:</b>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span>Finally, I want to leave here some links where you can contact me if you need it, follow
        me in the social media if you want to, or donate with Paypal (all options would be very
        helpful to keep improving this tool and even develop new tools).
