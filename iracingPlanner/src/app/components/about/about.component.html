    <div class="mt-1">
      <span>Hey there!</span>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span>My name is Albert and I am an enthusiast of simRacing. Some years ago I registered into
        iRacing and with the iRacing's PDF schedule I think it is quite complicated to plan a
        season depending on your preferences, cars and tracks... so after some seasons I decided
        to create this simple tool to help simRacers planning their season.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-1">
      <b>Instructions:</b>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span>Just select your owned cars and tracks in the corresponding tabs and you will see your
        season in the dashboard tab.</span>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-1">
      <b>Some notes:</b>
    </div>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li>At this moment, this tool uses a json produced with an iRacing API call and for now this
          needs to be updated manually every season. Please go to my Github repository to download
          a release for the current season. I will be updating it until I found an automatic
          solution for this.</li>
        <li>The list of cars and tracks are automatically generated with the mentioned json. It is
          possible that if a car or a track is not used and does not appear in the json, you won't
          find it in the list.</li>
        <li>In the mentioned json it is not specified which cars and tracks are free, so at this
          moment please select all cars and tracks that you own.</li>
        <li>Series with less than 12 races on the season are not shown properly, if you want to
          race this series please be careful because the weeks in this cases are incorrect</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-1">
      <b>Future steps:</b>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span>I know that this tool needs a lot of new features, fixes and improvements, but please,
      understand that I do not have a lot of time.
      You can provide me some feedback or comment new features in my Github repository or leave me a
      comment somewhere in the social media.
      New features planned includes:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>Series filtering by different columns</li>
        <li>Adding favorites series, cars and tracks</li>
        <li>Price calculator (if you want to plan what to buy)</li>
        <li>Default content should be selected by default</li>
        <li>Auto calculate current season instead of manually updating the json file</li>
        <li>Owned content loaded from your iRacing account</li>
        <li>Visual enhancements</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="mt-1">
      <b>Useful info and links:</b>
    </div>
    <div>
      <span>Finally, I want to leave here some links where you can contact me if you need it, follow
        me in the social media if you want to, or donate with Paypal (all options would be very
        helpful to keep improving this tool and even develop new tools).
